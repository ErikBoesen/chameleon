A proof-of-concept Mac app that disguises itself each time it runs, in order to avoid detection, for instance by a system that blocks certain apps.

# Usage
To enable randomized renaming, you must remove the file `name.txt` from the application bundle's directory. Alternatively, write in that file whatever name you would like.
